# Cluster Analysis for Customerâ€™s Segmentation

## Introduction
Unsupervised learning is an increasingly important branch of data science, the goal of which is to train models that can learn the structure of a dataset and provide the user with helpful pieces of information about new samples. In many different business sectors (such as marketing, business intelligence, strategy, and so forth), unsupervised learning has always had a primary role in helping the manager to make the best decisions, based both on qualitative and, above all, quantitative approaches.

Malls or shopping complexes are often indulged in the race to increase their customers and make huge profits. Hence, it is essential to know more about their customers and cluster those who have the same characteristics or features in the same cluster and separate customers who have no common in a different cluster. It would help businesses to focus more on the specific sub-group of customers for further planning.

The main methods we use in this study are Dissimilarity-based methods and model-based methods. The dissimilarity-based method includes KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and KPrototypes. The model-based method also involves Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
Furthermore, one primary constraint in most dissimilarity-based methods is the fact that they are based on distance/similarity metrics. So, dealing with mixed-type (continuous and categorical) data is a challenge. Most distance/similarity metrics like Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, and etc., handle continuous data, whereas some metrics like the simple matching introduced to deal with categorical data. In many applications, each instance in a data set is described by more than one type of attribute. In this case, the dissimilarity measures discussed before cannot be applied directly. This study examines Gower's metric to calculate the dissimilarity metric when we have mixed-type data. Moreover, we consider the KPrototypes algorithm that works well on mixed-type data. KPrototypes is a dissimilarity-based method that uses the KMeans and K-Mode clustering algorithm to handle mixed-type data.

## Procedure
This study is conducted in 3 main parts.
- First, we study the variables and their relations.
- Next, we use dissimilarity-based methods to cluster our data. Three algorithms (KMeans, Hierarchical CLustering, and KPrototypes) are employed for this purpose.
- Then, we use a model-based method using GMM with EM algorithm to analyze different clusters.

The summary findings are discussed after each part.
